                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I saw similarities from last article and how that article was 
                                talking about accessibility. The accessibility of some of the websites I saw in these articles
                                are the color contrasts to help the user understand where to go. Also some of the websites did not
                                have that much color but it still was helpful when seeing the page navigations as the whitespace
                                helped keep a lot of the items organized.

                            <p> I really loved the animations of the websites. I thought the Midnight hour website looked really nice aestheically.
                                I really loved the transitions that they included in the website. </p>

                            <p> My favorite one was the Midnight hour website. I thought the transitions were really smooth making
                                it satisfying to see. I also liked the contrast between black and white. Finally I loved the organization
                            of the overall page as it helped make the overall website more accessibile.</p>
