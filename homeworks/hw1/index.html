            I love to play chess and watch soccer. My favorite
            team is Bayern Munich and is why I want to visit Germany.  
            Other hobbies I have are cooking, teaching, and playing sports.
            Although I am not the best cook my goal is to learn how to bake and
            one day make tiramisu. Eventually, I hope to open a resteraunt or work
            in a top tier one.

        <h3> Part 2 </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Something I learned was that we should give the user suggestions in order to 
                get the use to be more interative with the website. By giving the user suggestions
                it can make them interact with your application if they themselves have no idea as 
                you are planting the seeds of thought.
            </li>
            <li>
                My favorite part was regarding the the fact that retweets and likes are bold
                which I thought was a really interesting thing. It makes you focus more on the post
                and if it is popular you would look more into it hence spending more time on the application.
            </li>
            <li>"Also, notice where the timestamp is shortened elsewhere in the app (e.g. “5h” on Feed view or “4/14/18” on Profile view). Think through the different intentions of those views."</li>
            <li>8/10</li>
        </ul>
